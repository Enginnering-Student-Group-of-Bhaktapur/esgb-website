      "The ESGB Orientation Program, held on June 12, 2023, was the inaugural event of the 20th ESGB Committee. The primary objective of the session was to familiarize the newly admitted batch of 2079 and also inspire senior batches to actively engage in upcoming ESGB events. The need for such an initiative arose from the observation of minimal participation by new members in major events like the Welcome-Farewell Picnic and Deusi-Bhailo. The dynamic session, conducted in the library hall, drew over 50 enthusiastic participants, predominantly comprising the then-first-year students. The program schedule featured a brief introduction and historical overview of ESGB, engaging quizzes, a captivating compilation video showcasing past committee events, lively musical performances, interactive games, and an open mic session providing a platform for new ESGB members to share and connect. The event concluded with a brief feedback session. The impact of the event became evident during the following Welcome Farewell Picnic, which witnessed the highest-ever participation from first-year students.",

Kora; started in 2011 is the biggest charity cycling ride in the Himalayas, with over 4000-5000 riders riding close to 175,000 km every year, in several locations in Nepal and around the world. Cycle Connect Bhaktapur conducted Kora Bhaktapur 23 with the main aim of promoting Bhaktapur as a national and international cycling destination by developing three different routes of 50, 75, and 100km that encircle the whole Bhaktapur district.

      "With a random idea of setting up a food stall during the exhibition at Pulchowk college, the ESGBians brought the taste of Bhaktapur to the college premises winning hearts everywhere. It was the January 26, 2024, the first day of LOCUS exhibition when about 120 juju dhau(king curd) and around 100 yomaris were the total estimation we made however, to our own surprise over 300 juju dhaus and over 200 yomaris were sold within the 3 days of exhibition. \
      Customers took the matkas that the juju dhau was served on home; some even did diy and kept them as mementos, sending us photos and glowing testimonials. It was an experience full of excitement for our first business, a lot of questions if it would work out or not but we also knew that if we worked together and gave it our all, we could make it great, so we went ahead and did it! our first food stall!",
